`Logistic Regression\Logistic_Regression_Tumours_Dummy_Data.ipynb`     
This notebook uses the Logistic Regression algorithm to predict the type of tumour (malignant or benign) based on the size of the tumour.

The dataset is a dummy dataset created within the notebook. Percentage noise can be set.  

A confusion matrix, an ROC curve and various other metrics are calculated and displayed.

`Logistic Regression\Multinomial_Logistic_Regression_Tumours_Dummy_Data.ipynb`

This notebook performs a multinomial Logistic Regression to predict the type of tumour (liver or lung or pancreas) based on the size of the tumour.

The dataset is a dummy dataset created within the notebook. Percentage noise can be set.  

A confusion matrix is displayed.
