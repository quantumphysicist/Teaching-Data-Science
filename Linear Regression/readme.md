# Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates **Locally Weighted Linear Regression (LWR)**, a non-parametric machine learning technique particularly effective for **nonlinear relationships** where local trends are meaningful. LWR assigns higher weights to data points closer to the query point, allowing for flexible, adaptive regression models.

## Contents
The notebook consists of:

1. **Introduction to LWR** – Explanation of the method and its advantages.
2. **Implementation in Python** – A code cell implementing LWR.
3. **Examples & Visualisation** – Applying LWR to an example dataset to illustrate its effectiveness.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
